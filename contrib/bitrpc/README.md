### BiRIZC
Allows for sending of all standard Bitcoin commands via RPC rather than as command line args.

### Looking for Wallet Tools?
BiRIZC.py is able to do the exact same thing as `walletchangepass.py` and `walletunlock.py`. Their respective commands in BiRIZC.py are:

	biRIZc.py walletpassphrasechange
	biRIZc.py walletpassphrase
